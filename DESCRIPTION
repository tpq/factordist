Description: This package measures the distance between factors. Most functions
    contained here work by tallying how often the elements of the factors
    equal one another. Some functions will treat the factor label in
    an absolute sense, while others will treat the factor label in
    a relative sense. The latter are useful for measuring the distance
    between clusterings, where the cluster label may be arbitrary.
